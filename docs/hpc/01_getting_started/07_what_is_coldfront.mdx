How do I:
-   Create a project: refer to [creating a project](08_coldfront_creating_a_project.mdx)
-   Request an allocation: refer to [submitting an allocation request](09_coldfront_requesting_an_allocation_request.mdx)
-   Approve an allocation request: refer to [approving an allocation request](10_approving_an_allocation_request.md)
-   View resources that are available to me: refer to [current allocations sub-section here](09_coldfront_requesting_an_allocation_request.mdx)

A coldfront allocation is needed to perform any work on Torch. The next sections describe the project and allocation request process in detail.
